JPM readme
JPM is now installed on your system. In the powershell, cygwin,
or other shells you can now type 'jpm', the output should be
self explanatory.

You can find more information about the command itself at 
https://www.jpm4j.org/#/md/jpmcmd

Security
This command must run in an elevated shell to install/uninstall 
applications (as it should be). It is strongly advised to only
run the jpm commands in this elevated console that modify the
setup. Applications and other commands should run in a normal shell.
